# FactorioRatioAssistantApp

The ratio assistant helps calculate exact ratios of machines to construct items, and all their intermediate components. 
It additionally shows how many belts are required to transport that amount of items.

## Installation

You can try it right away at [https://asampley.github.io/factorio/] or download an apk for android from [https://asampley.github.io/factorio/build/android/factorio-ratio-assistant.apk].

## Usage

Most help for actually using the application can be found by clicking the ? icon on the webpage or in the app.

## Configuration

You can select which level of machines to use, which level of belts to use, and which items to ignore in exact ratios (perhaps you don't care exactly how many furnaces you need for Iron Plates).

You can even create a version for your own mods, simply by running the script found at [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asampley/FactorioRatioAssistantApp/master/scripts/factorio-extract.lua].
The mods go in the www/mods folder (which can be found by going to the help section in the mods page). Make sure to add your new mod to the mods.txt file found there.
